# Adding a Tunnel

## Ktunnel

> A CLI tool that establishes a reverse tunnel between a kubernetes cluster and your local machine

## Setup

Ktunnel is set up and configured during the intial IBB installation script. It creates it's own certificates and creates a "link" back to an upstream kubernetes cluster which is configured to be the public ingress for your IBB. It uses a "sidecar" configuration where an additional pod is attached to each deployment which handles the tunneling. There is no additonal application set up required besides exposing a port which can be read by a "localhost" client

## Tunneling

In order to automatically create a ktunnel "sidecar" which establishes the outbound connection to your configured ingress cluster, the following needs to be added - usually in the `deployment.yaml` template for the pod

```
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # The request is the name of the ktunnel configuration, stored in 
        # ktunnel-config.kube-system.configmap.cluster.local
        injector.ktunnel.ibbproject.com/request: "ibb-ktunnel"

      labels:
        # The Padi ID or Context ID and the port you want to forward
        # The ID must match /kt-[a-z0-9]+/
        #   i.e. kt-grafanagui
        # but is typically kt-<CONTEXT-ID>
        # Port must be a string
        injector.ktunnel.ibbproject.com/id: <ID>
        injector.ktunnel.ibbproject.com/port: "<PORT>"
```

Additionally, the kubeconfig and the pod info Downward API need to be mounted as volumes into the pod. Continue editing the deployment of the pod:

```
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:

        [ ... The changes you made above ... ]

    spec:
      containers: [ ... ]
      volumes:
        - name: kubeconfig
          secret:
            secretName: "kubeconfig"
        - name: podinfo
          downwardAPI:
            items:
            - path: "labels"
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.labels
            - path: "annotations"
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.annotations
```

## Debugging Ktunnel Sidecar Injection

If your pod is not getting the sidecar added, be sure to check the ktunnel-injector logs. There is an injector pod running in the kube-system namespace that will log all of the actions and errors that the injector encounters.

```
kubectl logs -n kube-system <SIDECAR-INJECTOR-POD>
```

If your pod falls into a CrashBackoffLoop, be sure to check the ktunnel sidecar logs

```
kubectl logs <YOUR-POD> -c ktunnel
```
