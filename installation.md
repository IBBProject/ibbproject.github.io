# Installation Instructions

## IBB Script

See [https://github.com/IBBProject/installation/](https://github.com/IBBProject/installation/) for more details

## Connecting your IBB to IBB.zone {#connect}

During the installation process you will be prompted to link your IBB to Padi. This process allows your IBB to communicate upstream with the servers to manage the applications running on your IBB

To link your IBB to Padi you'll need the generated code from the terminal output.

Then, using a computer with an internet connection, navigate to IBB.zone and log in with your email address and password. Select the team under which you wish to install the IBB.

Once complete, go back to your terminal and press any button to continue. Your IBB will reach out to the servers to finish setting up the connection. When complete your terminal will read "INSTALLATION COMPLETE" and your IBB Application on IBB.zone will show "Online"
